# Ray Tracing in Many Languages

This repository contains my implementation of the [Ray Tracing in One
Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book
written in several different programming languages.

Generally the samples will only reach the end of section 8.5 as the chapters
after this point are further enhancements of the core ray tracer. These
additional features may be added in the future.

## Rules of Engagement

Here are the rules I've set for myself with this challenge:

1. All implementations must be written by myself.
2. Must be able to run at least on modern amd64 Linux (additional
   platforms/architectures are a bonus).
3. Stick to just standard library (unless not possible).
